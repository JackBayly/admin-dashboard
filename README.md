# Admin Dashboard (CSS Grid Practice)

Live preview: https://jackbayly.github.io/admin-dashboard/

<p>An admin dashboard project to practice CSS Grid and Flexbox. Part of The Odin Project curriculum.</p>
<p>Here's a live demo: https://jackbayly.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/ </p>
<h2>Things Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>CSS Grid</li>
  <li>Flexbox</li>
  <li>CSS combinators</li>
  <li>CSS attribute selectors</li>
  <li>Selecting/manipulating elements with JavaScript</li>
  <li>A new way to use for loops</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The page is not responsive. I mainly just wanted practice with CSS Grid and Flexbox.</li>
  <li>No functionality. But again, it was built for CSS practice.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>I'm happy with the final result. I set out to cement my understand of Grid and I definitely acheived that goal. I am more confident in my Grid (and Flexbox skills). Honestly I wish I had learned them earlier because they save a lot of time when making page layouts and alligning elements. </p>
